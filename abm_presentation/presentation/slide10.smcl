{pstd}
The Agent Based Models  implemented in Mata as a {* digr <a href="#slide11.smcl">&gt;&gt; class</a>}{view slide11.smcl:>> class}{* /digr}

{pstd}
They use a collection of helper classes available in the {browse "https://github.com/maartenteaches/abm":ABM}
package. 

{pstd}
The main classes availbe in the {cmd:abm} package are:

{pmore}
o {help abm_pop} can store a list of agents and their properties. It is 
particulary helpful when at each point in time most agents' properties are
stable, but some change.

{pmore}
o {help abm_nw} for storing and managing a network

{pmore}
o {help abm_grid} for storing and managing a grid (like a chessboard) on which 
agents can "live" and interact with one another.

{pmore}
o {help abm_util} useful functions that can be imported into the model class
