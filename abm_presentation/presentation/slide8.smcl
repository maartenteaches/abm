{pstd}
The basic SIR model could represent how a disease spreads in a specific town

{pstd}
we could place multiple SIR models on a grid (like a chessboard) and see how
the disease spreads across this space 

{pstd}
In the first round a number of people in a single town is infected 

{pstd}
In all subsequent rounds

{pmore}
the disease spreads within each town as before, but then

{pmore}
some agents visit neighbouring town and potentially spread the disease there
