{pstd}
An Agent Based Model is a simulation in which agents, that each follow simple rules, 
interact with one another and thus produce a often surprising outcome at the macro 
level. 

{pstd}
The purpose of an ABM is to explore mechanisms through which actions of the 
individual agents add up to a macro outcome, by varying the rules that agents have
to follow or varying with whom the agent can interact.
