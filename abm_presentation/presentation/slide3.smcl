{pstd}
14 days is a number that has floated around a lot for how long someone is 
infectious when having COVID-19. 

{pstd}
On average 4 contacts is just a convenient number 

{pstd}
The transmissibility is then chosen to make the R0 close to 2.5, another number
that has floated around a lot for COVID-19.

{pmore}
If someone is 14 days infectious, and contacts 4 persons each day, then there 
are 14*4=56 opportunities to infect someone. 

{pmore}
These should result in 2.5 infections, so the chance of a contact leading to an
infection is 2.5/56 = 0.045
