{pstd}
To add the network we make use the {helpb abm_nw} class.

This takes care of creating the network and keeps track of who can contact who.

{pstd}
With that the changes required are fairly small

{pstd}
The class definition is 

{* codefile nw_main.do }{pstd}{stata "doedit nw_main.do":here}{p_end}

{pstd}
Checks and setting parameters are pretty much the same

{pstd}
The main simulation functions are

{* codefile nw_sim.do }{pstd}{stata "doedit nw_sim.do":here}{p_end}
