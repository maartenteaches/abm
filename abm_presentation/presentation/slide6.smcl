{pstd}
The model thus far does not need a simulation; one can compute them with a set
of differential equations. 

{pstd}
In Stata you can do that with {cmd:epimodels} by Sergiy Radyakin and Paolo Verme

{pstd}
However, the advantage of Agent Based Models is that it is much easier to expand
the model.

{pstd}
For example, what if we don't believe that people contact each other randomly 
but instead it is a network that determines who contacts who. 

{pstd}
A common model that works fairly well for a lot of social networks is a small 
world network:

{pmore}
We assume all agents are on a circle, and that each agent is connected to the 4
closes agents.

{pmore}
However, a small number of these connections are replaced by a connection to a
random agent

Close knit networks tend to slow down the spread of a disease, while the long 
distance ties tend 

{pstd}
So that is one way in which advise against unnecesary travel or "social buble"
rules in countries like Belgium works
