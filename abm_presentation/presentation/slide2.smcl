{center:{bf:Example: The spread of a disease}}

{pstd}
In this model each agent can be in one of three states:

{pmore}{it:Susceptible}: the agent is healthy, but can get the disease.{p_end}
{pmore}{it:Infectious}: the agent has the disease and can spread it to others.{p_end}
{pmore}{it:Recovered}: the agent has had the disease and is now immune.{p_end}

{pstd}
In the first round one or more agents get infected.

{pstd}
In all subsequent rounds:

{pmore}- All infectious agents have a chance to become recovered, and{p_end}
{pmore}- all recovered agents get a chance to become susceptible.{p_end}
{pmore}- All agents that are still infectious contact a random number of other 
agents{p_end}
{pmore}- Each of these contact has a chance of resulting in an infection if 
someone is susceptible.
